Subject: Week 3 Pool Results - Spitting and Winning!

Hey Team,

What a week! Douglas soared to the top with **6 points**, thanks to his crystal ball that correctly predicted the Falcons and Steelers. Meanwhile, Skylar wasn’t far behind with **5 points**, proving that sometimes you just need to ride the coattails of the right teams. Amy snagged **3 points**, and I’m still trying to figure out how I only managed **1 point**—I guess my picks were more like “wishful thinking” than actual predictions!

In case you missed it, Jalen Carter made headlines by getting ejected just **6 seconds** into the Dallas-Philly game. Is that a record? Someone should check! As we gear up for next week, remember: it’s all about strategy, a sprinkle of luck, and maybe a little less spitting on opponents. 

Stay tuned for next week’s matchups, and may the best picker win!

Cheers,  
Mark
